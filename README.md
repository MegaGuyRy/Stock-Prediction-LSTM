# Stock prediction LSTM

### Overview
This project was designed as my final project for my Into to AI course at Harrisburg University. It focuses on building an LSTM model from the ground up so I could gain more experience working with different AI models and what goes into them. I used public historical data form Yahoo Finance to train the model to predict the prices for some of the largest stock picks on the US stock exchange.
